During the transition to a new Applicant Tracking System (ATS), a client asked for a redesign of their careers page. When I took on the project, employees were copying text from Word documents and pasting the content into web templates.


### Sample.js
The code I wrote reaches out to an API where all career related data is housed, pulls in all relevant data, and displays current openings on the company's "Careers" page. Once displayed on the "Careers" page, the openings are filterable by job type, job location, and job category. The script also allows visitors to search the list of openings. 


### Sample2.js
This script loads content on to the job specific pages.
